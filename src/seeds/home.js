    bio : `My name is Alex Pachino and I’m a musician from Los Angeles.
    If I were to define my musical capabilities, I’d say that they’d be
    best used to write songs, produce records and perform live.
    But surely more is possible.  All I know for certain is that I have
    a deep love for art, music creation, collaboration and great songs.
    My hope is that this website gives you a strong sense of who I am
    and the kind of work I do.
