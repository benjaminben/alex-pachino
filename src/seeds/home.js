           I'm carrying the wheel
           Thanks for all you've shown us

           Come sit next to me
           Pour yourself some tea
           Just like Grandma made
           When we couldn't find sleep
           Things were better then
           Once but never again
           We've all left the den
           Let me tell you about it`,
